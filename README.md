# CSS Wireframe

### Summary
This wireframe page is an incredibly simply page I made to practives spacing out divs within one another. 

### The goal of this project
This wireframe serves no purpose apart from practiceing manual spacing in CSS for div ids.

### File Structure
The project is made esentially with one page styled using the materialize CSS library, and interacting with Two different API's to retrieve information. To share that information, the side pushes and pulls from a firebase table into a share section on the left. 

### Instructions
There is no actual functionality to this page.
